Solution for OA from Kargo

In this problem, we have such assumptions:
1. The lengthes of s1 and s2 are equal. If we detect that they are in different lengthes, we print "False".
2. Case sensitive, meaning that "A" and "a" are different.
3. The "One to One" mapping is in order, which means the first character in s1 can only be mapped to the first character in s2.
4. There are always enough inputs in arguments which is three. If there aren't, we print "Invalid Input".
